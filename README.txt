This repo is a graveyard for abandoned HTML projects. 
Hi,
My name is Anu and I'm a bioinformatician in training at ELTE, class of '24. 
I am actively working on a MySpace inspired webpage (since 2022) on https://mistymoon.neocities.org/. 
This page experiments with earlier days of the internet with very flat and visually sharp graphics that aimed to invoke a sense of nostalgia!
You can click on the sections above the home page and you will be redirected to several pages. It is continually in development and I update it whenever I have a new idea.

Thanks for reading!
Enjoy your stay!
